Skycons for Android (Work-in-Progress)
======================================

![alt text](https://github.com/torryharris/Skycons/blob/master/Skycons/skycons.gif "Skycons")

We set out to create a native weather app on Xamarin but we wanted to build something unique to differentiate ourselves amongst the plethora of weather apps avaialble out there. The [DarkSky](http://darkskyapp.com) app & [Forecast](http://forecast.io) did an excellent job with their [Skycons](http://darkskyapp.github.io/skycons/). 

We wanted to re-use the same icons for our app as well, however, we found that these animated icons don't exist natively on either platforms. This is currently a work-in-progress as the team is finetuning the animation & the performance itself. You can download the complete project
